## 🎯 OBJECTION HANDLING

### "Too expensive"
*"I understand budget is important. Our Basic package at 50 zł often pays for itself with just 2-3 additional tickets. Plus, no contracts - try one event and see the results."*

### "We already use Facebook/Instagram"
*"That's smart! EventFinder works great alongside social media. We target people actively searching for events to attend, while social media targets your existing followers. Different audiences, complementary strategies."*

### "We don't see the ROI"
*"Totally get it. That's why we offer detailed analytics - exactly how many people clicked, when, and from where. Plus we can start with one smaller event as a test case."*

### "We need to think about it"
*"Of course! How about I set up a free trial listing for your next event? No payment needed, just see how it performs. If it works, we can discuss ongoing partnership."*
